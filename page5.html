    <h1>my experience</h1>
    
    <div style = "margin: 0px; width: 60%; min-width: 400px;">
        <p>I've only had stinky tofu twice- once in a night market in Taiwan, and another in a food festival in New Jersey that I recently went to.</p>
        <p>The first time I had it, I was really pleasantly surprised- it actually tasted good to me.</p>
        <p>The second time- I remember being extremely excited seeing a Taiwanese food stall in New Jersey, and I knew I had to support it (#asianrepresentation). 
            I bought some for my friends to try it out for the first time, but I fell a lil disappointed
            when they made faces of absolute disgust when they tried it. One of my friends even
            had to spit the food out because she hated it so much (honestly her loss).
        </p>
        <p>It honestly tasted really fragrant to me and the tofu was marinated really well with great taste, flavor and spices!
            But I was also pretty shocked at how fermented + funky it tasted!</p>
        <p>I really like how unique it tastes though- I don't think I've ever eaten anything as funky as this.
            I think the main reason why I like it so much is the fact <span class="highlight">it's so weird that I can't help liking it.</span> 
        </p>
        <p>I definitely recommend getting stinky tofu the next time you see it! It's such a <span class="highlight">great experience
            eating it with friends and seeing their reactions as well!</span>
