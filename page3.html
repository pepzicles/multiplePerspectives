    <h1>how it's made</h1>
    <p style = "width: 60%; min-width: 400px;">
        Stinky tofu is made in a variety of ways, with the precise fermentation 
        process varying from one street stall to the next (and often kept a secret). 
        The key is the fermented brine in which the tofu is soaked. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Traditionally, it’s made from <span class="highlight">fermented milk, vegetables, and meat,</span> but might also include 
        ingredients such as dried shrimp, amaranth greens, mustard greens, bamboo 
        shoots, and Chinese herbs. The brine is left to ferment for <span class="highlight">several months</span>, 
        creating a highly potent mix.
