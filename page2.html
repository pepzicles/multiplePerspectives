                    <h3>Changsha, Hunan</h3>
                    <p>
                        Different from other forms of tofu, Changsha-style has black crackling. 
                        It is made from brine composed of winter bamboo shoot, koji, and shiitake 
                        mushrooms. After the surface grows white hair-like filaments, and once it 
                        turns grey, the stinky tofu is ready to be fried.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Nanjing, Jiangsu</h3>
                    <p>
                        There is one famous kind of stinky tofu in Nanjing, called "Gaochun 
                        stinky tofu". It has different kinds of brine than Changsha style stinky 
                        tofu. The brine needs to be made of rotten pickles and its stinky smell 
                        will be very natural. Similar to Changsha-style stinky tofu, it also has 
                        black crackling.

                    <h3>Sichuan</h3>
                    <p>
                        In Sichuan, stinky tofu is often flavored with mala, a spicy and 
                        numbing seasoning made from chilli and Sichuan peppercorns. Sichuan-style 
                        stinky tofu does not need to be deep fried in the oil, so it does not have 
                        black cracklings. It needs to be stirred fried and boiled with different 
                        kinds of spices.
