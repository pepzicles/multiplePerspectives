    <h1>legendary origins</h1>
    <p style = "width: 60%; min-width: 400px;">
        According to a legend, it was created from a happy accident. 
        A shop owner with unsold tofu that had gone untouched for days, 
        discovered that his supply of bean curd and soy milk had <span class="highlight">turned 
        green and begun to ferment.</span> Despite its foul odor, the owner 
        decided to taste the tofu instead of wasting it and found it was 
        actually pretty tasty. 
        <br>
        <br>
        From there, he began to sell the stinky 
        tofu with great success, eventually impressing China's Empress 
        Dowager Cixi of the Qing Dynasty and landing his product on a 
        list of foods served at the imperial palace during the 1800s.
